# Smart-Weather_Agent

- Description
- 
<p>The Smart Weather Agent is a small Python program that helps people check the weather in a very easy way. Instead of searching on the internet or opening a weather app, you can just run this program and it will tell you the weather using a natural, human-like voice. When the program starts, it tries to find your city automatically using your IP address. If it finds the city, it quickly gives you the weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather. This makes the experience fast and comfortable for the user.

A very special feature of this project is its voice output. The program uses a text-to-speech engine to speak in a soft and natural voice. The speaking speed is slow and clear, so it sounds more like a real person and not like a robot. If the program cannot detect your city, you can simply type any city name. The agent will then speak and show the weather for that city. It keeps running and answering until you type “exit” to stop it.

To make everything work, the program uses a few important tools. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data, IPInfo to find your location, the requests library to talk to the internet, and pyttsx3 to speak the weather details. There are also simple error checks so the program does not crash if the internet fails or if a wrong city name is typed.

Overall, the Smart Weather Agent is a friendly and helpful little program. It talks to you, gives you weather information quickly, and is very easy to use. This project shows how Python, APIs, and voice technology can be combined to create something simple, useful, and enjoyable for everyday life.</p>
